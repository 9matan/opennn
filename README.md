# OpenNN
OpenNN is a software library written in C++ for predictive analytics. It implements neural networks, the most successful deep learning method. The main advantage of OpenNN is its high performance. This library outstands in terms of execution speed and memory allocation. It is constantly optimized and parallelized in order to maximize its efficiency. 

The .pro files are project files for the Qt Creator IDE, which can be downloaded from its [site](http://www.qt.io). Note that OpenNN does not make use of the Qt library. 

The documentation can be found at the official [OpenNN site](http://opennn.net).
